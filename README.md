# panopticon-roulette
- Spent all of one night making this mini-game for my creative project for the honors class The Society of Spectacle.
- The design and themes of this game are based on class discussions of vision/power and axes of meaning with regard to images/text.
- The game is simple and is played using only spacebar.
- The player presses space once to freeze the moving spotlight along one axis, and a second time to lock it onto a single prison cell.
- The objective is to reveal a hero and avoid revealing a monster.
